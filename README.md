put all 3 files in the same folder anywhere then run the main executable (MAKE SURE YOU RUN IT BEFORE OPENING ROBLOX, ALSO USE AN ALT CAUSE IM NOT SURE IF THIS IS BANNABLE OR NOT YET)

you can edit settings.json and put your fflags there

DO NOT ADD FFLAGS TO DATASTORE.JSON

when roblox updates and it stops working head here https://github.com/Srungot/FFlags-dumper-roblox/tree/main then go to the latest version and paste the new flags.json into datastore.json

you will also need to download the new exe here because it includes the new offsets

have fun
