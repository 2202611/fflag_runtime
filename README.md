download latest release then run (MAKE SURE YOU RUN IT BEFORE OPENING ROBLOX, ALSO USE AN ALT CAUSE IM NOT SURE IF THIS IS BANNABLE OR NOT YET)

you can edit settings.json, change the preset flags and put your fflags there

DO NOT ADD FFLAGS TO DATASTORE.JSON

when roblox updates and it stops working run the updater to fetch latest version

have fun
